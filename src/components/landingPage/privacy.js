                        updates may occur without prior notification, but if the

                        the confidentiality of personal information is protected
                        and maintained but we cannot guarantee the absolute
                        security of any information. We regularly review our
                        compliance with these Privacy Policies and in case we
                        receive formal written complaints then we shall contact
                        the person who made the complaint to follow up. We work
                        with the appropriate regulatory authorities, including
                        local data protection authorities, to resolve any
                        complaints regarding the transfer of personal data that
                        we cannot resolve with our users directly.
